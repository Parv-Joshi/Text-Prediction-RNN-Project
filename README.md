# Text Prediction RNN Project

This is an individual project done to showcase an introductory example of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). This was a project created in Python by following this [tutorial](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/build-a-simple-predictive-keyboard-using-python-and-keras-b78d3c88cffb) by [Ijas A H](https://medium.com/@ijas.ah). This was created for an  in-class group project taken for credit for my AMS 380 (Data Mining) course at Stony Brook University.

This project uses Python 3.9. You can find the program code ([Text Prediction Using a LSTM RNN Model.ipynb](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/Text-Prediction-RNN-Project/blob/main/Text%20Prediction%20Using%20a%20LSTM%20RNN%20Model.ipynb)). This project uses a very simple LSTM RNN Model to predict the next three highest probable words given the previous word, very similar to the text prediction we find in our phone keyboards. The base text used for this was the book [The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/Text-Prediction-RNN-Project/blob/main/TheAdventuresOfSherlockHolmes.txt), whose .txt version is also a part of this repository.

For this projects, the following Python libraries were used: [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/learn), [Keras](https://keras.io/), [Natural Language Toolkit (nltk)](https://www.nltk.org/). These libraries can be installed by using the following commands in the terminal:

```
pip install numpy
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
pip install nltk
```
