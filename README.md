# Text Prediction RNN Project

This is an individual project done to showcase an introductory example of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

This project uses Python 3.9. You can find the program code (Text Prediction Using a LSTM RNN Model.ipynb). This project uses a very simple LSTM RNN (with Machine Learning) Model to predict the next three highest probable words given the previous word, very similar to the text prediction we find in our phone keyboards.
